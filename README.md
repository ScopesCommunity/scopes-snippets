# scopes-snippets

For small, reusable pieces of code that slightly extend the language or do some common task, but wouldn't make sense on the default distribution or as a part of a library. Contributions are welcome.

Note that the modules in `snippets/` aren't meant to be imported directly, but instead copied and integrated to your codebase as you see fit. For that reason they are either self contained (core-only) or depend only on libraries from the standard distribution.

To add a snippet, open a pull request. Rules for inclusion:
- No external dependencies
- Must include comments and or docstring clarifying purpose and functionality
- Authorship information goes at the top of the file (optional)

## LICENSE
By submitting a snippet you agree that your code is now under Unlicense (public domain).
